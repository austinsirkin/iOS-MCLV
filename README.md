# Project Title

This is the original MailChimp List Viewer that I created for iOS using Swift in January 2018. It's the first app I ever created in Swift, or in anything else, so please forgive any "rookie" mistakes.

## Getting Started

These are the project files, but the main bits are in the "MailChimpListTest" directory, so to get started, I'd head there and then check out the various .swift files. Ideally, though, you'd open the project in XCode.

### Installing

As these are the project files, to install it, you'll need to open the project in XCode, then compile it.

## Built With

This was written, as per the instructions, using no third-party frameworks or libraries, so only the stuff that comes with XCode.

## Contributing

No contributing is allowed at this time.
